<center>Welcome to this tiny drop of bits in the Internet's ocean! </center>

I'm RMCD or romano on most of my netizen profiles.  

Coming from Normandy, France, I am based in Switzerland since 2011 and I work for an IT Hardware manufacturer and Digital Signage solutions developer company.

Besides work, I dedicate my spare time following latest tech trends, striving to maintain my wobbly, unsound level on my guitar, or most of times doing outdoor sports out there in the moutains.  I am also active in various local communities and associations.

In this website are centralised some personal & professional content, in english _ou en fran√ßais_, such as:

## Articles about
* Digital transformation & solutions, online strategy, etc. Well, it's been kind my job for a while so I guess this isn't a surprise
* ICT, cryptocurrencies, privacy, society and other personal interests in general
* _published here or on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@r_mcd)_

## CV & projects showcase
Obviously, since I'm ~~actively searching right now~~ not looking for job opportunities :-)  
Still, you may want to have a look at my [projects & portfolio page](https://r-m-c-d.github.io/projects/).
