<center>Welcome to this tiny drop of bits in the Internet's ocean.</center>

My name is Romain Marchand, aka RMCD on most of my digital profiles.
I'm a freelance digital marketing projects consultant based in Nyon, CH, for almost 4 years now, right now looking to get back to an employee position.
I dedicate my spare time following latest ICT & tech trends, trying some geeky stuff on my Linux machines, collecting old laptops to give them a second life and donate them (contact me if you're in my region and want to get rid of some!), striving to maintain my wobbly, unsound level on my guitar, or riding through majestic Swiss Alps on a bicycle, a motorbike, or a pair of skies, depending conditions..  

In this website, I centralise some works or contributions of mine, both personal & professional, in english ou en français. You'll find:

## Articles about
* Digital marketing, SEO, VR, etc. Well, no surprise, that's kind of my current job so.. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
* ICT, tech, cryptocurrencies, software reviews or technology in general
* Sports - probably around the ones I practice, lifestyle, thoughts
* Well, litterally anything I'd like to write one of these days, it's my site after all. Get your own!
* published here or on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@Romain_Marchand)

## CV & projects showcase
Obviously, since I'm actively searching...  
Speaking of which, here are some documents you may want to check (PDF links):
* [Digital-web-IT Project Coordinator](https://cloud.disroot.org/s/SHeXcnS9dci5YCP) detailed CV. This a generic version and personal details have been deleted, so feel free to [connect and contact me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marchandromain/) if you're looking for a job-specific version  
* [Written recommendations](https://cloud.disroot.org/s/C6rfsnQcym8qYzE) from former coworkers or managers    
* My [projects portfolio page](https://r-m-c-d.github.io/projects/).
