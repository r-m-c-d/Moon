* Science, ICT, technology in general, software reviews, etc
* Sports mainly around those I practise or follow: trekking, hiking, backpacking, swimming, mountain or road cycling, running, skiing
* Litterally anything else I'd like to write one of these days, it's my site after all. Get your own!

## CV & projects showcase
Quite obvious, since I'm looking for a job right now \o/. Speaking of which, here are some documents you can check:
