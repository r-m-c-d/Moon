<center>Welcome to this tiny drop of bits in the Internet's ocean! </center>

I'm "rmcd" or "romano" on most of my netizen profiles.  

Coming from Normandy, France, I am based in Switzerland since 2011 and I work for an IT/electronics manufacturer & Digital Signage solutions development company.

Besides work, I dedicate my spare time thoroughly doing lots of outdoor sports out there in the moutains while trying not to break any of my bones, or striving to maintain my wobbly level on my guitar, or simply playing with my kids - those tiny humans are actually quite time consuming!

I am also active in various local communities & associations, and committed to several volunteering / pro bono projects. [Check this page](https://r-m-c-d.github.io//volunteering-and-pro-bono-projects/) for more details.

This website has no ambition whatsoever other than serving as an easy repository for both personal & professional content, in english _ou en fran√ßais_. You may find:

## Articles about
* Digital solutions, tech tools or reviews, etc. Well, it's been kind my job for a while so no surprise here;
* ICT, cryptocurrencies, privacy, society and other personal interests in general
* _published here or on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@r_mcd)_

## CV & projects portfolio showcase
Obviously, since I'm ~~actively searching right now~~ not looking for job opportunities :-)  
You may want to have a look at my [projects & portfolio page](https://r-m-c-d.github.io/projects/).
