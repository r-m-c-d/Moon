<center>I am a naturally curious, 'detail oriented realistic' profile and bachelor-level multilingual young professional, with +10 years working in Sales, Marketing, Customer Support, IT Support, Business Administration & Project Coordination in industries such as Pharma & Biotech engineering / IT / B2B & B2C service / FMCG & retail / digital & web marketing / tourism.      
Considered as a hard worker, I'm also an excellent team player and coordinator with good analytical mindset, a subtle blend of emotional balance, intuition & curiosity, and always eager to learn.  
    
I dedicate my spare time following latest ICT & tech trends, trying some geeky stuff on my Linux machines, striving to maintain my wobbly, unsound level on my guitar, or riding through majestic Swiss Alps on a bicycle, a motorbike, or a pair of skies, depending conditions..
