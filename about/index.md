<center>Welcome to this tiny drop of bits in the Internet's ocean.</center>

My name is Romain Marchand, aka RMCD on most of my netizen profiles.
I'm a naturally curious, versatile and multilingual professional with cross-sectional skills varying from technical, digital & IT project coordination to traditional marketing, sales & business administration.  

I dedicate my spare time following latest ICT & tech trends, trying some geeky stuff on my Linux machines, collecting old laptops to give them a second life and donate them (contact me if you wanna get rid of some!), striving to maintain my wobbly, unsound level on my guitar, or riding through majestic Swiss Alps on a bicycle, a motorbike, or a pair of skies, depending conditions :-)  

In this website, I centralise some personal & professional content, in english _ou en français._

## Articles about
* Digital transformation & solutions, online strategy, etc. No surprise, that's kind of my current job so.. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
* ICT, development, cryptocurrencies, security or technology in general
* Outdoor and mountaineering sports I practice
* Well, litterally anything else I'd like to write, it's my page after all. Get your own.
* _published here or on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@Romain_Marchand)_

## CV & projects showcase
Obviously, since I'm actively searching right now...
