<p align="center">Welcome to this tiny drop of bits in the Internet's ocean.</p>
<p align="center">I'm "rmcd", or "romano", on most of my netizen profiles.</p>


French. Based in Switzerland. Working for a globally recognized and award-winning IT-electronics manufacturer & software development company where I mainly dedicate to channel business analysis for our worldwide distribution, operational support in order-to-cash process for our main distributors, and projects requiring to analyze business process improvements then map & design automated workflows. 

Sitting at crossroads between Tech & BizOPS, I thrive in projects requiring hands-on & understanding of technical IT constraints while keeping end-user/business needs in mind.

People usually say I'm a loyal and outgoing person whose relentless curiosity and desire to learn drive him to quickly grasp the ins and outs on projects. See some recommendations below.

Besides work, I'm thoroughly into outdoor sports (mainly mountain biking, road cycling, triathlon, skiing, trail running, open water swimming) while trying not to break my bones (which is a success so far!). I have a keen interest in technology evolution, open source and privacy matters, as well as in overall crypto & blockchain technology, for which and I am active in several communities or projects. 

I'm also involved in various local communities & associations, committed to several volunteering & pro bono projects, and member of the editorial board of a local paper. [Check out this page](https://r-m-c-d.github.io//volunteering-and-pro-bono-projects/) for more details about these.

This website has no ambition whatsoever other than serving as an easy repository to link both personal & professional content, in english _ou en français_ since I natively speak baguette, évidemment.

Here you may find:

## Articles about
* Digital solutions, tools, reviews or tutorials, open source and own built templates, etc.
