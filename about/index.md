<center>Welcome to this tiny drop of bits in the Internet's ocean! </center>

I'm "rmcd" or "romano" on most of my netizen profiles.  

Coming from Normandy, France, I am based in Switzerland since 2011 and I work for an IT/electronics manufacturer & Digital Signage software development company, where I mainly work on business analysis & operations (global sell-in/sell-out data collection & processing, reporting, dashboards) and order-to-cash process analysis and workflow automation (on Power Automate).

Besides work, I dedicate my spare time thoroughly doing outdoor sports (mainly cycling, triathlon, skiing, trail running, but above all, mountain biking) while trying not to break any of my bones, which is a success so far, and striving to maintain my wobbly level on my guitar, or simply messing around with my kids - those tiny humans are actually quite time consuming!

I am also active in various local communities & associations, and committed to several volunteering / pro bono projects. [Check out this page](https://r-m-c-d.github.io//volunteering-and-pro-bono-projects/) for more details.

This website has no ambition whatsoever other than serving as an easy repository for both personal & professional content, in english _ou en français_. You may find:

## Articles about
* Digital solutions, tools, reviews or tutorials, open source and own built templates, etc. 
* ICT, cryptocurrencies, privacy, society, sports and other personal interests in general
* _published here or on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@r_mcd)_

## CV & projects portfolio showcase
Obviously, since I'm ~~actively searching right now~~ not looking for job opportunities :-)  
Still, you may want to have a look at my [projects & portfolio page](https://r-m-c-d.github.io/projects/).
