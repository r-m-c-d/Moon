<center>Welcome to this tiny drop of bits in the Internet's ocean \o/ </center>

I'm Romain Marchand, aka RMCD on most of my netizen profiles.  

Coming from Caen, Lower Normandy, France, I am based in Switzerland since 2011 and work on digital and ICT projects.  

Besides work, I dedicate my spare time following latest tech trends, trying some geeky stuff on my Linux machines, striving to maintain my wobbly, unsound level on my guitar, or riding through majestic Swiss Alps on a bicycle, a motorbike, or a pair of skies, depending conditions :-)  

In this website, I centralise some personal & professional content, in english _ou en fran√ßais_, such as:

## Articles about
* Digital transformation & solutions, online strategy, etc. Well, that's kind of my job so..
* ICT, cryptocurrencies, privacy, society and other interests in general
* _published here or on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@Romain_Marchand)_

## CV & projects showcase
Obviously, since I'm actively searching right now...
