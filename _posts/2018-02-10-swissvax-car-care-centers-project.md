# Projects portfolio
## Swissvax Car Care Centers
##### Role: Project manager, tech lead
##### Period: 09.2017 – 02.2018

Swissvax is a worldwide active retailing and car care group and manufacturer of its own wax for cars and yachts care. Their customer loyalty is very decent and stable, but they needed to reach people more widely around their local subsidiaries. My role for them was to lead a local SEO pilot project first for their swiss headquarter which was later extended to several subsidiaries (Glarus, Zürich, Basel, Limmattal), mixing traditional & digital marketing (ranking, Google My Business, Facebook, local websites, Youtube channels, etc) and my 360° content specialities (interactive virtual tours based on Google Streetview) in order to grow online presence and user onpage retention.   

_This project was realised under the banner of my partner [3Pack Consulting](https://www.3pack.ch/), contractor here, and assigned to me._

The concept of most projects we do at 3Pack Consulting consists in increasing local ranking of companies by providing sort of a "digital pack" with focus on Google My Business listing, SEO oriented local website (= in addition to HQ/corporate website when there is one) and an embedded interactive virtual tour, which has proven many times impressive user average time spent on pages we manage. As the 3Pack anme implies, the goal is to rank our customers in the so-called Google 3-pack, the 3 first results Google highlights after a search.
In the case of Swissvax centers, we also voluntarily shoot inside beautiful car to better immerse the user into the inside leather care environment. Look, see yourself inside this stunning Porsche at Zuerichsee center:
