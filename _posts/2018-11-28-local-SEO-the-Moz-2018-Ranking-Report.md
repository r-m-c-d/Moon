#### *The Local Ranking Report for 2018 has just been released by Moz.com. As in previous years, Google is increasingly focusing on completing the Google my Business Account.*

If the rankings already were strongly dependent on these factors, then this has risen again massively this year. The importance of GMB (Google My Business) signals has risen from 19% to 25% and the significance for the appearance in the 3-pack search results has increased by 38%. This significant increase largely depends on several new features Google has implemented in GMB.

## Google Posts
As you might expect, Google Posts new feature is rewarded. This offer is still being used by too few and thus posters have an advantage over the mass of content providers. We everyday encourage our customers to further take advantage of this tool which unfortunately stays too little known except for Digital marketing professionals. Imagine having an option to make your special and limited offers or new products directly showcased on the first impression Internet users have of your business, or having a micro-blog function directly attached to your GMB profile. Sounds appealing, right? Well that's what Google Posts feature is about! You can define a time limit for your post, in case of a temporary offer (Christmas, Easter, Mother's Day, etc), upload a nice picture of your product, or even embed a Youtube video.

## Other factors
Among other GMB features such as Q&A, very useful for the users, you also find a website builder, services, messaging, etc. 
The study also concludes that Google reviews are becoming increasingly important. Not only that number and quality is another ranking factor, but Moz.com recommends answering all reviews. This is no surprise and always has been an element I always insist on when I speak to my customers. Not only you show presence and reactivity, both to the good reviews and (even more) the bad. A potential customer thus gets a better picture and in addition, you can incorporate some important keywords.
