#### *This is no secret that I’m actively looking for a job — as of right now at least. And in a few interviews I’ve recently landed, a recurrent “question”, not to say an obvious concern, came up from my interviewers once in a while. It encouraged me to write a few words describing the hidden side of running a small business…*

_Tl; dr: here’s my [mailbox](mailto:rmcd.projects@gmail.com?subject=[Source_GitHub] first contact), get in touch and hire me :-)_

"_So, I can see you’re working as freelancer for more than 3 years now, aren’t you afraid of getting back to a corporate life?_” is the most common way I’m asked. Although subtle, it often underlines a bit of a concern in the recruiter’s voice. Occasionally, the question is turned quite more frankly: “_there would be things like.. you’d have to be at 8am in the office and respect some offices rules, you know_”, or “_you will have direct synergies with your coworkers around and often face customers_”, as if I was a lazy, mad, sectarian antisocial.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not criticizing my past / future interviewers here, and I can’t blame them for trying to tickle me on any potential vulnerability that could matter for the position. I’ve been sitting on this recruiter chair, too. I always take this matter with understanding and a bit of amusement, detailing how running a small business is what you can consider a real job and why it’s probably more demanding that some could guess — except maybe for those who’ve been on this dark side too. It’s just frustrating when the person in front obviously doesn’t seem to believe you.
