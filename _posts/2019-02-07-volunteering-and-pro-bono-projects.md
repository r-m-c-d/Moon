**2020:**
- on May 30th & 31st during the [One Million Run](www.onemillionrun.ch) race, I will be running for little Elio and CVDA association and collect 1CHF by kilometer from several people! More infos [here on my website](https://r-m-c-d.github.io//one-million-run-CVDA/).

**2019:**
- **_(Ongoing):_** member of the editorial committee of local newspaper VichFAIT. Often writing articles but more specifically in charge of articles compilation, minor corrections and proofreading, layout edition and final submission for print out.

- **CRM deployment**: implementation and configuration of AgileCRM for [3Pack Consulting](https://www.3pack.ch/), a partner company I worked a lot with and that has brought me many digital consulting missions these past years. In summary: overall quick consulting and analysis, filtering & cleaning of customer database, setup CRM accounts/profiles, uploading data, testing, basic workflow automation, etc.  

Since I'm always curious and it was a "calmer" project being rolled out with few users and constraints, I took the opportunity to try using a new tool named Glo Boards for this project's governance. Part of GitKraken, a GUI client for Git, Glo Boards is an additional feature allowing a simple and intuitive Trello-like task tracking. It supports Markdown, allows inviting other users and assign tasks, you can filter your tasks among different cards and tags, and their UI is really cool #unpaidpromotion

- **_(Ongoing):_** As a blockchain & cryptocurrency enthusiast and curious person, I'm involved in a group named Swiss Crypto Traders with dozens of other people, active in Swiss Romandie region, where we have our own chats and organize monthly meetups in Lausanne, Geneva or Fribourg.

**2011:** 
- **_(Ongoing):_** revamping old computers for donation: giving old PC a new life by installing light Linux distributions and donate them to relatives or their children: it makes a cheap and perfect first computer for a kid and it is ideal for them to better understand underlying technology.  
Then I learned that what most refugees need whey they land in a camp in Europe is communication material. Indeed, very often the supply in food is sufficiently covered by associations and donations (at least according to people I've spoken to), but they lack basic computer/mobile phones to communicate with their families. So I still want to collect more old PC/phones and keep on revamping them to then to donate to associations helping refugees or people in need. 

**[Contact-me](mailto:rmcd.biz@gmail.com?subject=IT equipment donation) if you have private or corporate deprecated equipment to get rid of, or any idea or project.**

Speaking of which, I thank [NNE Pharmaplan](https://www.nne.com/) for having given me multiple robust Dell laptops that I have later revamped, as well as an old patch bay and network switch, and also more recently, in 2019, [SpinetiX](https://www.spinetix.com) for giving several lots of PC tower + screen also in perfect condition, that this time I donated to Geneva-based cooperative [Itopie.ch](https://www.itopie.ch/) which promotes the use of Open Source solutions and provides solutions, trainings, park maintenance, etc, to people, institutions and private companies as well.

**1999-ongoing:**
#### Windows, Linux, digital & privacy awareness and overall ICT support

Being naturally curious, I kind of always wanted to open things to see what's inside, be it with a palpable mechanical toy or within a digital solution. Although more than often, it meant not being able to re-build it, tightening the screw too much, irreversibly breaking the wood, making the system unstable or crashing it. At least I was learning how to reinstall!

Feeling attracted to Open Source philosophy in the early 2000's, I frequently helped buying/mounting/configuring many kinds of PC/hardwares/small networks for people, learning by doing while helping people and [spreading best practises and awareness](https://medium.com/@Romain_Marchand/hygi%C3%A8ne-num%C3%A9rique-protection-donn%C3%A9es-data-cleaning-r%C3%A9duction-sources-d8b4984ba755) towards personal data and privacy matters. And it's still the case nowadays.

Spoiler: trying to be an evangelist doesn't work much! Most people simply want a _"it-just-works"_ machine and Windows has a proeminent position on both domestic & professional markets. However, with a diplomatic approach I succeeded in converting quite some people over the years, including my own parents (and THAT is quite a challenge!), very happy on their Ubuntu for several years and very rarely asking me to take control remotely to fix anything. I think they mostly don't see any difference and at least I got rid of _"computer is being slower and slower everyday, can you help?"_ that I heard all along their Windows years. 

I mostly know about Debian-based distributions, have very few experience with other distros and am overall just a Linux padawan, continuously learning.

In the recent years, I also advised or worked on digital, ERP-CRM, imaging, SEO or general web and IT pro bono projects. This includes setting up domains, managing / sorting / cleaning data, testing or giving feedback on beta versions on friends projects, creating online presence and basic SEO tools and publishing content for SMEs or people in my network.

## Other occasional engagements or notable projects:

**2015: European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education**  

accompanying a young swiss hearing-impaired teenager and his educational referrent from the Swiss Center for Specialized Education to represent Switzerland for a few days at European Hearing 2015, organized by the [European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education](https://www.european-agency.org/), at European Parliament in Luxembourg.
The delegation was composed of 72 teenagers and their accompanying adults from all european countries. Multiple workshops and plenary sessions were held, bringing suggestions, ideas or experience feedback from their own local school, such as what measures can be taken to facilitate their education, how teachers can help them follow a traditional scholarity, or which equipments are or should be provided.  

Watch "[_Young people's impressions from the 2015 european Hearing_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcPlFVvKWkw&feature=youtu.be)", on European Agency's Youtube channel.

**2011: European Rallycross**  

volunteer team assistant for norwegian rallycross driver Svein Roger Andersen, engaged in [European Rallycross Championship](https://www.fia.com/events/european-rallycross-championship/season-2018/fia-european-rallycross-championship). Former [national rally driver](https://sites.google.com/site/bilsportcaravan/bilsportsutoevere---norske/a/andersen-svein-roger), Svein was competing in ERC. Together with a friend, I was in the team for the two championship stages in Hell, Norway, and Höljes, Sweden, the latter one being by far the most iconic event in rallycross history that every fan wants to attend at least once. 
We mostly assisted in basic support, like putting the sponsor stickers on the bodywork of the car, setup & dismantling the booth in the paddocks for races events, etc, while travelling with the team on races and private car tests and living in the team accomodated bus.

**2009-2010: Music shows and local bands promotion**  

I have been a clumsy, flawed guitarist for years, although I do have fun, but my passion for music led me to be a member of Art'Shaker in Caen, France, an association promoting regional music bands and producing local live shows on stage or in local businesses. Included scene structure (dis)assembling, back and front stage coordination and support to artists.
