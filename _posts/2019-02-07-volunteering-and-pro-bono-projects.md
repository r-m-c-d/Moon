#### 1999-ongoing:
#### Windows, Linux, digital & privacy awareness and overall ICT support

I kind of always have been the nerdy one among my friends and family, it all started around 1999 in school where I was among the 1st ones to have a computer at home, running on Windows. I quickly got a lot of interest in understanding how it worked, exploring the machine both in terms of software (very often trying things but breaking everything, which made me learn how to reinstall..) and hardware (upgrading elements and assembling PC). At that time, I was helping classmates with installations of OS or softwares (cracked keys were easy in that time^^), or burning music CDs for friends, since most kids were transitioning from the good old Walkman to the portable CD, there was a whole new pocket-money market raising!   

As a curious teen, I quickly felt attracted by Open Source philosophy and systems. Here comes Linux. Over the years, it has been easier and easier to install graphically and run it, and since I like to share knowledge I naturally turned into a Linux evangelist and tried to convert everyone and show them how easy it was. Plot twist: doesn't work! Most people simply want an "it-just-works" machine and Windows already had a proeminent position on both domestic & professional markets. However, with a diplomatic approach and if you take time to train and show people of it works according to their needs, it's doable. I succeeded in converting quite some people, including my own parents (and THAT is a challenge!), very happy on their Ubuntu for several years and very rarely asking me to take control over TeamViewer to fix anything. I mostly know about Debian-based distributions, have very few experience with other distros and overall am just a Linux padawan.  

I frequently helped buying/mounting/configuring many kinds of PC/hardwares/small networks for people, helped them understanding what they do while [spreading best practises and awareness](https://medium.com/@Romain_Marchand/hygi�ne-num�rique-protection-donn�es-data-cleaning-r�duction-sources-d8b4984ba755) towards personal data and privacy matters.

In the recent years, I also advised or worked on digital, ERP-CRM, imaging, SEO or general web and IT (personal or commercial) projects. This includes setting up domains, managing data, testing or simply giving feedback on beta versions, creating online presence and basic SEO tools and publishing content.

**2019: CRM deployment**
implementation and configuration of AgileCRM for [3Pack Consulting](https://www.3pack.ch/), a partner company I work a lot with and that has brought me many digital consulting missions these past years. In summary: overall quick consulting and analysis, filtering & cleaning of customer database, setup CRM accounts/profiles, uploading data, testing, basic workflow automation, etc.  

Since it is a "calmer" project being rolled out with few users and constraints, hence giving me much liberty, I took the opportunity to try using a new tool named Glo Boards for this project governance and followup. Included in GitKraken, a GUI client for Git (usually more oriented towards software projects since it connects directly yith your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repositories), Glo Boards is an additional feature allowing a simple and intuitive task tracking (Trello-like). It supports Markdown, allows inviting other users and assign tasks, you can filter your tasks among different cards and tags, etc. Plus, their UI and overall graphic design is really cool, that's always nice \o/

**2018-ongoing**:
- Epicerie Chez Goran, Vich, CH: [creating GMB](https://goo.gl/maps/M7XP1im9uGs) (Google My Business) profile, shooting and uploading business pictures, training the owner how to use it and create content and posts, and promoting importance of SEO and especially customer reviews on GMB.
Also basic IT support for email configuration and network (fax/printer)
- As a blockchain & cryptocurrency enthusiast and curious person, I'm involved in a group named Swiss Crypto Traders with dozens of other people, active in Romandie, where we have our own chats and organize monthly meetups in Lausanne, Geneva or Fribourg. I also [published a tutorial](https://r-m-c-d.github.io//nimiq-mining-on-google-cloud-updated-guide/) for mining a currency called Nimiq on an external cloud platform.  

**2016**:
- Promoting local places in my own small town of Vich, CH, where I live, such as [WWII bunker](https://goo.gl/maps/UwRzXPRAbKN2) on Streetview, the inauguration of a [new roundabout](https://goo.gl/maps/4Lo63Jvbyv12) and a new [wooden bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/kidQSw44uwu), which have all cumulated thousands of views.
- Points-Coeur, a UN recognized NGO, [Charity Gala at Mandarin Hotel](http://suisse.pointscoeur.org/Soiree-de-charite.html) in Geneva, CH: shooting, editing & publishing of a [video of the event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hetcnZ5eZfQ), and photo shooting.

**2011-ongoing: revamping old computers for donation**
giving old PC a new life by installing light Linux distributions and donate them to relatives or their children (it makes a cheap and perfect first computer for a kid and it helps them better understand underlying technology). Then I learned that what most refugees need whey they land in a camp in Europe is communication material. Indeed, very often the supply in food is sufficiently covered by associations and donations (at least according to people I've spoken to), but they lack basic computer/mobile phones to communicate with their families. So I want to collect more old PC/phones and keep on revamping them to then to donate to associations helping refugees or people in need. **If you leave nearby and have some equipment you want to get rid of, contact me!** Companies: corporate equipment is good too! I thank my former employer [NNE Pharmaplan](https://www.3pack.ch/) for having given old decommissioned but robust Dell E6400s that I have later revamped, as well as an old patch bay and network switch.

## Other engagements:

**2018-ongoing: local town association**
member of the association "Vich en Fête", the festivities committee of the small town I live in: organisation of the annual party (budget, booking, animators, food & beverages, etc) and local events

**2015: European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education**
accompanying a young swiss hearing-impaired teenager and his educational referrent from the Swiss Center for Specialized Education to represent Switzerland for a few days at European Hearing 2015, organized by the [European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education](https://www.european-agency.org/), at European Parliament in Luxembourg.
The delegation was composed of 72 teenagers and their accompanying adults from all european countries. Multiple workshops and plenary sessions were held, bringing suggestions, ideas or experience feedback from their own local school, such as what measures can be taken to facilitate their education, how teachers can help them follow a traditional scholarity, or which equipments are (or should be) provided.

This has been one of the most exciting projects I came to discover and it clearly helped me strenghten my wish to turn my career more towards causes I have interest in or which encompass concrete added value for the people, may it be for commercial companies bringing their users/consumers a better life through science or technology, or ideally for NGOs.

**2011: European Rallycross team**
team assistant for norwegian rallycross driver Svein Roger Andersen, S.R. Andersen Motorsport, engaged in [European Rallycross Championship](https://www.fia.com/events/european-rallycross-championship/season-2018/fia-european-rallycross-championship). Former [national rally driver](https://sites.google.com/site/bilsportcaravan/bilsportsutoevere---norske/a/andersen-svein-roger), Svein is now competing in ERC. Together with a friend, I was in the team for the two championship stages in Hell, Norway, and Höljes, Sweden, the latter one being by far the most iconic event in rallycross history that every fan wants to attend at least once. We mostly assisted in basic support, like putting the sponsor stickers on the bodywork of the car, setup & dismantling the booth in the paddocks, etc, while travelling with the team on races and private tests and living in the team accomadated bus. Unforgettable moments for a rallycross fan!
